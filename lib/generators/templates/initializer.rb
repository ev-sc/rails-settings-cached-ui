  # You must define the schema of your rails-settings-cached model. The hash must be two levels deep.
  # The keys in the first level define the sections in the UI, and the keys within each of these define the individual
  # settings you want to appear within each section. For example:
  #
  # SCHEMA = {
  #   ui: {
  #     section_label: 'User Interface',
  #     live_updates: {
  #       type: :boolean,
  #       label: 'Live Updates',
  #       description: 'Animated icons display in the background in response to mailings and action'
  #     }
  #   }
  # }

  SCHEMA = {}
